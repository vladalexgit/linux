How to sign nvidia driver kernel modules to work with uefi:

1) create a key to use for ALL signatures:

sudo su
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout UEFI.priv -outform DER -out UEFI.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=username/"

2) import the key you have just created into the UEFI firmware on the machine

mokutil --import UEFI.der

Reboot the PC and you will be asked by MOK Manager to confirm the insertion of the key. Make sure to provide your user password

You can check the key has beed inserted properly by using:

dmesg | grep "EFI: Loaded cert"

3) you can now install the nvidia driver from the ubuntu ppa repository

sudo add-apt-repository ppa: graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt-get update

!!!!!! Say NO to prompt asking you to disable secure boot !!!!!!!!!

sudo apt-get install nvidia-370 ???

The driver has been installed but cannot be loaded until it is signed with a trusted key

4) Proceed to sign all kernel .ko modules in nvidia updates dkms folder

EXAMPLE:
/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha 256 /home/alex/UEFI.priv /home/alex/UEFI.der /lib/modules/4.4.0-31-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia370.ko

(and nvidia_370_drm.ko nvidia_370_modeset.ko nvidia_370_uvm.ko)
